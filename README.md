# Chalkboard
Site where everyone can draw anything; Hack4pan submission

## Why?
This project, that you could call a 4chan for artists (ill get into this analogy more later)
was made to represent the internet, you could call it a social experiment because it very much is that.
It was made to make it easy to visualize a question that has been bugging everyone for years
especially in these trying times of the pandemic. That question is "Can humans cooperate?". 
You can observe the question really well through watching the canvas and chat go absolutely wild drawing masterpieces
but also destroying art and being cunts towards eachother. This website is like 
an art 4chan because there is no identification or rules. Anyone can at any point
join one of the 5 provided servers and just draw, no matter what who when or where.

This site, this project, was made to represent the internet as a whole, it was built to show 
the internet's true potential. It was built to represent the internet as a *society* and
to show if people can thrive in such an environment by cooperating and creating some sort of
mutual agreement to not destroy art.

The in-site chat was initially not intended to exist but i decided to add it
in the last moment as to provide easier communication between artists.

## More insight on the technical difficulties of this project
This project was built mostly on my phone and im incredibly proud of
the fact that it was built in those conditions and in 5 days.

Somehow i managed to bodge together a testing setup using termux and i just wrote code. 
By some miracle it almost all worked when moved onto a server.

Also i had to learn 2 things i didn't ever use before for this project:
Websockets and HTTPS (getting the certificates delayed getting demo images and video for quite a while)

## Demo

You can also see the current state of the canvas and participate in it yourself using [this](https://graphite2213.github.io/chalkboard.html)
link.

Here is an image of the canvas after the first 10 hours:

i was promptly asleep while this went down but it seems like at first there was fighting for canvas space and there was some vandalism although people started asserting dominance by drawing larger and more beautiful images so it stopped. Also a single person seems to have taken over server #2
